0.7.0 (06/23/2014)

Refactoring of qmore reserver to break it into its component pieces
making it more flexible.

Added strategies for the reservers:
Sources - where we pull the Qless::Queue from (Enumeration that returns Qless:Queue)
Filters - filters out queues from Sources based on some criteria (acts as a Source)
Ordering- Reorders the results of an iteration through an enumeration.

Added a Delegating Reserver which delegates down to a collect of reservers to
find jobs.

Added Background Source which updates its available queues asynchronously
